#Comparing Graphs

As the cursor is hovered over any of the graphs, specific metric values are shown for a time interval highlighted by the vertical line. Time interval length varies from 15 minutes to 3 hours to 12 hours, depending on whether the date range is set to Today/Yesterday, Last 7 Days, or Last 30/90 Days respectively. Moreover, the same time interval is highlighted on both graphs at the same time for comparison and correlation purposes.
